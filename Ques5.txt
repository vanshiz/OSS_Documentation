Project Structure
main.c: Contains the main function, which serves as the entry point of the program. It handles command-line arguments, converts them to integers, and calls the appropriate functions to perform arithmetic operations.
functions.c: Contains the implementation of the basic arithmetic functions.
functions.h: Header file that declares the functions implemented in functions.c.


How It Works
main.c
Purpose: Provides the entry point of the calculator program.
Functions:

main:
Prints the number of command-line arguments and the first argument (program name).
Checks if at least two additional arguments are provided.
Converts the first two arguments to integers.
Calls the functions add, subs, prod, and divid to perform the arithmetic operations.
Prints the results of these operations.

functions.c
Purpose: Implements the basic arithmetic operations used by the calculator.
Functions:
int add(int a, int b): Returns the sum of a and b.
int subs(int a, int b): Returns the difference when b is subtracted from a.
int prod(int a, int b): Returns the product of a and b.
int divid(int a, int b): Returns the quotient when a is divided by b. Note: This function does not handle division by zero.

functions.h
Purpose: Declares the arithmetic functions implemented in functions.c.
Functions:
int add(int a, int b);: Declaration for the addition function.
int subs(int a, int b);: Declaration for the subtraction function.
int prod(int a, int b);: Declaration for the multiplication function.
int divid(int a, int b);: Declaration for the division function.
